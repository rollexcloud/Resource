    4. Batch Processing
      • Spring Batch basics
      • Job configuration
      • Readers, processors, and writers
    5. Reactive Programming
      • Spring WebFlux
      • Reactive streams
      • R2DBC for reactive database access
Phase 5: Microservices with Spring Boot (6-8 weeks)
    Learn to build and deploy microservices:

      • API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)
      • Service discovery (Eureka)
      • Circuit breakers (Resilience4j)
      • Configuration server
    2. Containerization
      • Docker basics
      • Containerizing Spring Boot applications
      • Docker Compose for multi-container setups
    3. Orchestration
      • Kubernetes basics
      • Deploying Spring Boot apps to Kubernetes
      • Helm charts
Phase 6: Production Readiness (4-6 weeks)
    Focus on making your applications production-ready:
    1. Monitoring and Observability
      • Actuator endpoints
      • Metrics with Micrometer
      • Distributed tracing with Sleuth and Zipkin
      • Log aggregation (ELK stack)
      • Prometheus and Grafana
    2. Performance Tuning
      • JVM tuning
      • Database optimization
      • Connection pooling
      • Caching strategies
      • Load testing with tools like JMeter
    3. CI/CD
      • Setting up pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
      • Automated testing
      • Deployment strategies
    4. Cloud Deployment
